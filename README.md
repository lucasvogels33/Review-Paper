Dear reader,

This folder contains all code to reproduce the results in the article "Bayesian Structure Learning in Undirected Gaussian Graphical Models: Literature Review with Empirical Comparison" by Lucas Vogels, Reza Mohammadi, Marit Schoonhoven and Ilker Birbil from the Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Amsterdam. Please contact me at l.f.o.vogels@uva.nl for any inquiries about the code.

The reproduce the results for a certain number of variables p, a number of obervations n, and a graph type, there are three steps to be taken:
Step 1: Create an instance and solve the instance using each of the five selected algorithms (G-PLBD, G-PLRJ, BD-A, RJ-A, and SS-O).
Step 2: Calculate the relevant metrics for each solution.
Step 3: Plot the metrics

This folder only contains the code for the case of ten variables (p=10). The code for instances with more variables is similar.

Kind regards,

Lucas Vogels
